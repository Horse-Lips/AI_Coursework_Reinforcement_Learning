AI Coursework. Reinforcement learning agents which learn COVID mitigation strategies using Sebastian Stein's ViRL epidemic environment https://git.dcs.gla.ac.uk/SebastianStein/virl.

Trains a Q-Learning agent with a single RBF function per possible move at each turn (four moves are possible in the ViRL environment. This agent's performance was compared to a random agent and a deterministic agent (Performs a certain action given certain circumstances in the environment) to show improvements. The states of the environment are also analysed as well as the rewards received by each agent. More information can be found in the notebook.
